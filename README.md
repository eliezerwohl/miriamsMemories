Mission:
There is an informal test used when a healthcare client start to show signs of dementia.  The purpose is to record a set of answers, and compare them to a later answer session, to see what the person remembers, or where they think they are.  This page aims to solve two problems.  The first is that that questions aren't standarized.  The second is that they are often done on paper, which for a hospital or home care service can be a problem.
